DVFS Controller Performance Analysis Report
==========================================
Generated: 2026-02-21 04:05:50
Workload: CPU_Intensive
Type: MEMORY_INTENSIVE
Duration: 189 seconds
Total Samples: 63 (baseline), 49 (DVFS)

WORKLOAD CHARACTERIZATION
-------------------------
This is a memory-intensive workload:
- High L3 miss rate and memory bandwidth → CPU stalls on memory
- Frequency scaling has limited impact on IPC
- Ideal strategy: Moderate frequency to save energy without hurting performance

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
- Energy Savings: +34.6% ✅
- IPC Change: -8.0% ❌
- L3 Miss Rate Reduction: -8.5% ❌

KEY METRICS
-----------
default DVFS:
  Avg Power:     50.17 W
  Avg IPC:       1.368
  Avg Freq:      3.22 GHz
  Avg Temp:      62.3 °C
  L3 Miss Rate:  0.099

With SW-DVFS:
  Avg Power:     42.21 W
  Avg IPC:       1.259
  Avg Freq:      2.40 GHz
  Avg Temp:      63.7 °C
  L3 Miss Rate:  0.108

DVFS Level Distribution (With SW-DVFS):
  Low: 30 samples (61.2%)
  High: 14 samples (28.6%)
  Medium: 5 samples (10.2%)

CONCLUSION
----------
❌ The DVFS controller is too aggressive — it boosts frequency unnecessarily, wasting power without improving performance.
